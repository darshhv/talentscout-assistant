## Project Overview

TalentScout AI Hiring Assistant is a powerful, AI-driven chatbot designed to streamline technical interviews by generating tailored interview questions based on candidate profiles and technical stacks. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Cohere API for natural language understanding and generation, this assistant allows recruiters and hiring managers to conduct structured, personalized interviews seamlessly.

This project supports interactive question-answer sessions, collects candidate responses, and summarizes results, thereby improving interview efficiency, fairness, and quality.

---

## Features

* **Candidate Profiling:** Collects candidate name, experience, and technologies known.
* **Dynamic Question Generation:** Generates technical questions for each tech skill with difficulty gradation (easy, medium, hard).
* **Interactive Chat UI:** User-friendly interface for real-time Q\&A.
* **Answer Recording:** Stores candidate answers during the interview session.
* **Summary Dashboard:** Displays question-answer pairs and skill-wise insights.
* **Export Options:** Save interview summaries as PDFs for record keeping.
* **Robust Prompt Design:** Fine-tuned prompts ensure relevant, high-quality questions.
* **Deployment Ready:** Easily deployable on Railway or similar platforms with environment variable support.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web UI
* **Cohere API**: Language model for question generation
* **Git & GitHub**: Version control and source hosting
* **Pandas & Matplotlib**: Data visualization for summary dashboard

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+ installed
* Git installed
* A Cohere API key (sign up at [Cohere](https://cohere.ai))
* GitHub account (optional, for cloning and version control)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshhv/talentscout-assistant.git
cd talentscout-assistant
```

### Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key:

```
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
```

### Step 5: Run the app locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser to interact with the TalentScout AI Hiring Assistant.

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Input Candidate Details

* Enter candidate name, years of experience, and select known technologies from the sidebar form.

### Step 2: Generate Interview Questions

* Click “Generate Interview Questions” button.
* The AI generates tailored questions per technology skill.

### Step 3: Conduct Interview

* Answer questions interactively in the main chat UI.
* Your answers are saved automatically.

### Step 4: View Summary Dashboard

* After answering, view summary with all Q\&A pairs and skill-wise insights.
* Export summary as PDF for records.

---

## Detailed Module Breakdown

### Candidate Information Module

* Captures candidate profile details to personalize interview questions.
* Uses Streamlit widgets for input controls: `text_input`, `slider`, `multiselect`.

### Question Generation Module

* Crafts a dynamic prompt incorporating candidate info and tech stack.
* Sends prompt to Cohere API with specific parameters (`temperature`, `max_tokens`).
* Parses AI output to extract and display questions.

### Answer Collection Module

* Uses `st.session_state` to persist candidate answers in real-time.
* Maps each question uniquely to store and retrieve answers.

### Summary & Export Module

* Collates questions and answers into a structured format.
* Visualizes skill-wise answer completeness using charts.
* Generates exportable PDFs using `fpdf2`.

---

## Prompt Engineering

### Rationale

Good prompts are key to producing relevant, targeted interview questions. Our prompt:

* Includes candidate name and experience for context.
* Enumerates technology stack explicitly.
* Requests difficulty gradation (easy, medium, hard).
* Specifies JSON output format for easy parsing.

### Example Prompt

```
You are an expert technical interviewer.  
Candidate Name: John Doe  
Experience: 3 years  
Technologies: Python, React, AWS  

Generate 3 interview questions for each technology, varying difficulty: easy, medium, hard.  
Return answers as JSON with tech keys and question arrays.
```

### Prompt Variations Tested

* Including candidate experience vs. excluding it.
* Asking for question topics vs. complete questions.
* Adjusting temperature from 0.4 to 0.8 for creativity control.

---

## Deployment Guide

### Deploying on Railway

1. **Create Railway account** and install Railway CLI.
2. **Initialize project**: `railway init` inside repo.
3. **Set environment variables** on Railway dashboard (`COHERE_API_KEY`).
4. **Deploy**: `railway up` or push code to GitHub linked repo.
5. **Monitor logs** with `railway logs`.
6. **Access live app** via Railway-generated URL.

### Alternative Deployment Options

* Heroku
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Docker container (see Docker section below)

---

## Docker Deployment (Optional)

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

### Build and Run

```bash
docker build -t talentscout-assistant .
docker run -p 8501:8501 talentscout-assistant
```

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

* Use `pytest` framework.
* Tests cover prompt generation, session state management, API response handling.

### Sample Test

```python
def test_build_prompt_includes_all_tech():
    prompt = build_prompt("Alice", 4, ["Python", "AWS"])
    assert "Python" in prompt and "AWS" in prompt
```

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Problem: Questions not generated

* Check API key validity.
* Verify internet connectivity.
* Review prompt format for errors.

### Problem: Session answers lost

* Ensure `st.session_state` is properly initialized.
* Upgrade Streamlit to latest stable version.

### FAQ

* Can I add more tech stacks?
  Yes, update the multiselect options in `app.py`.

* How to customize question difficulty?
  Adjust prompt instructions to AI accordingly.

---

## Security Considerations

* Keep API keys secret using `.env` and deployment env variables.
* Use HTTPS in production.
* Sanitize all inputs to avoid injection attacks.
* Monitor API usage for anomalies.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

* Fork repo, create feature branches.
* Follow PEP8 and project coding conventions.
* Include tests for new features.
